This project focuses on automating the control of fans and lights in a college laboratory using a mobile application and Alexa voice commands. The system is built using the NodeMCU, a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, and relay modules, which act as electronic switches to control the electrical appliances.
The NodeMCU is programmed to communicate with the mobile device and Alexa via Wi-Fi, enabling seamless interaction with the lab's electrical systems. Users can operate fans and lights either through their smartphone or by issuing voice commands to Alexa, providing both convenience and energy efficiency.
This automation setup reduces manual intervention, enhances user experience, and introduces a smart IoT-based solution for everyday lab operations. The system demonstrates how low-cost hardware and efficient programming can bring modern automation to educational environments.
