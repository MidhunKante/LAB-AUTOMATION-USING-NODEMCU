Developed an IoT-based automation system to control fans and lights in a college laboratory using a mobile application and Alexa voice commands. The solution leverages NodeMCU, a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, and relay modules to manage electrical appliances seamlessly. The system enables users to operate devices either via a smartphone or through voice commands, enhancing convenience, energy efficiency, and reducing manual intervention. This low-cost, scalable setup demonstrates the integration of IoT technologies in educational environments, providing a modern and efficient approach to laboratory management.
